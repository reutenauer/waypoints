# A solution to the Waypoints challenge

## Installation
This solution is Written in Ruby.  It should be enough to have RSpec installed
and run `rspec` in the top-level directory (here) to see the main test cases;
if needed, a Gemfile is provided, so that one can run `bundle` to install the
appropriate dependencies.

The solution is the last entry in the spec file, that calls #map and #reduce
on the main class, with the data provided.
